# Force-Volume-IR-processing
In this repo you'll find a python script to process the datas obtained by the Force-Volume IR mode of AFM-IR. It is a streamlit app, made in the AFM-IR team of the Institut de Chimie Physique of Paris-Saclay University, to help users of Musiics plateform (https://www.icp.universite-paris-saclay.fr/musiics/) to process their data. To run it you need streamlit (https://streamlit.io/) in your python environment.  
Once you've downloaded the script, open a terminal under python, and use the lines code :  
cd [path_to_script]  
streamlit run FVIR_peak_processing.py
